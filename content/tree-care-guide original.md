The centrepiece of your garden is always your trees. They attract attention, look beautiful, and add value to your property. Nothing beats relaxing on a hot summer's day in the shade provided by a linden, maple or oak. Maintaining them can appear difficult and often costly, discouraging homeowners from working on them until it's too late.

We at Der Baumchirurg want to show you that simple tree care does not have to be a chore or cost much money. With our simple five-point plan, you too can show you've got the green finger and make your tree the star of your garden layout. We've even included an extra sixth step for when all else fails.

## Planting Location for Trees

Knowing your soil type and its suitability for the tree you're about to grow is the first step for success. Different trees will grow successfully depending on where you choose to plant them.

The primary soil types in and around Berlin are sandy, loamy sand, and silty sand. These are deep and well-drained soil types, making them ideal for the growth of Linden, Maple, Oak, Plane, and Chestnut trees. Not sure what soil type you have? Check out this guide by Gardeners' World here so you can be prepared.

## How to Water Your Trees

How often you water your trees is going to depend on their age. Young trees require regular watering to allow them to grow roots. Maintaining damp soil at this stage is essential. But don't worry, your hard work will pay off. As they begin to mature, trees will only need to be watered on a small number of occasions. Drought conditions mean a lack of moisture for trees to live off, so remember to water during the hot summer months.

## Buy or Make Bark Mulch

Bark mulch is an essential ingredient in providing moisture to your trees. Go to your local garden centre and pick up a bag for a cheap price, or better yet, spend no money and collect bits of trees, twigs and leaves throughout the year and store them in a bag. When the summer season arrives, you will have a large supply of bark mulch. Not only does this keep the soil wet, it also keeps the soil cool, stops weeds growing, and protects the tree from damage.

## Prune and Trim Your Trees

Remove dead, diseased, and undesirable branches by simply chopping them off. Branch rot can spread, and by removing it quickly, you allow your tree to breathe naturally by improving the airflow. Timing for this is essential and depends on the type of tree you have, so feel free to contact us for some free advice and consultation on when the best time to prune or trim your tree is.

## Monitor and Remove Disease and Pests

Regularly inspect your tree for signs of disease, discolouration, and signs of damage. Not sure what you're looking for? Check out this handy guide to know exactly when your tree is suffering. Depending on the amount of damage, an expert opinion will be required to decide what the best step to take is. Tree inspection is one of the many services we provide at Der Baumchirurg.
