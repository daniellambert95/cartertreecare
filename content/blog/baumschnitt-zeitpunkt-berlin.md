# When and How to Prune Trees Properly

This guide teaches you proper pruning! Get the best results all year round!

Pruning is an essential skill in tree maintenance. Simply put, it's the process of removing dead, diseased and unwanted branches from your tree, allowing it to grow successfully. Pruning can also be used effectively to thin out a canopy, allowing sunlight into your garden and plants below. Small steps to protect the health of your trees will have a lasting impact on your garden's ecosystem. The process of removing unnecessary foliage seems simple, but some important information needs to be remembered before beginning that will make a big difference. Follow our guide, which lays out the essential information on Dublin and Irish tree care.

## What Are The Greater Dublin Area Tree Laws?

Tree pruning and maintenance in the Greater Dublin Area is regulated by local councils and national wildlife protection laws. These regulations are designed to protect nesting birds and preserve urban tree canopy. The bird nesting season typically runs from March 1st to August 31st, during which heavy pruning and tree removal may be restricted. Tree Preservation Orders (TPOs) may apply to significant trees, requiring permission from your local council before any major work. This includes removal of large branches, crown reduction, and structural alterations. Dublin City Council, South Dublin County Council, Fingal County Council, and DÃºn Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council each have specific guidelines. If you're unsure about regulations affecting your trees, please contact us for a free consultation and compliance advice.

## When Do I Prune My Trees?

The best time of year to prune your trees will depend on the type of tree you have. Normally, pruning takes place during late winter or early spring. This is right before the growing season and allows your tree the best opportunity for success. Pruning maintenance can be done all year round to promote healthy growth. Fruit trees are pruned specifically in winter to allow a successful harvest between July and August. You should avoid freezing weather conditions as pruning then will expose your tree to the chance of disease.

## What Tools Should I Use For Tree Care?

Using the correct and safe tools will save you time, energy and avoid injury while you maintain your trees. The essentials include secateurs, bypass pruners, loppers, and a pruning saw (for large branches). Before beginning, make sure the tools you're using are sharp and rust-free. This allows efficient removal of branches. If you are pruning multiple trees, clean your tools in between with alcohol to stop the chance of disease spreading. Safety gear is also important. We advise wearing gloves, helmets and eye protection.

## How To Plan Your Tree Trimming

Before beginning, decide how you will shape your tree to get the results you want. Take note of all the diseased and unnecessary branches that need to be removed. This should be your first priority, as this impacts the health of the tree the most. Thinning is the process of removing branches to allow air circulation. To do this successfully, it must be done in line with the tree's natural shape. Done together with shaping (rounding the edges of a tree to create balance), it will create standout results in your garden.

## Tree Cutting Best Practices

Technique is developed over time. Don't rush into it, as you risk hurting yourself and damaging the tree. Branches should be cut back to a bud, a branch or a main trunk. You are aiming to allow the branch to grow back without leaving a stub. A clean cut leaves no room for disease to grow. Removing branches at an angle will further encourage healthy and successful growth for your tree through proper healing.

## What Is The Three Cut Method?

The three-cut method is the most effective way of removing larger branches from your tree. We recommend learning to prune smaller and more manageable trees before proceeding with this method. The purpose of this method is to stop bark ripping, which occurs if you make a single cut at the base of the branch due to the weight of the branch. To do this method first, undercut the branch 20cm - 30cm from the trunk. Cut roughly one-third of the way into the branch. Make a second cut 3cm - 4cm further up and away from the trunk. This cut comes from the top down. Keep sawing until your branch breaks free. The branch should fall without any tears on your tree bark. You are now free to remove the remaining stump cleanly. Avoid cutting into the branch collar (the thicker protruding elements of the trunk) to encourage healthy regrowth.
